        <h1 class="heading_style">Game Night Ideas and Resources</h1>
        <p>There's a wide variety of games to choose from. Whether you like classic board games, trivia, card games, or head to head games. 
            There's enought to choose from that everyone would enjoy. Get as creative as you would like. You can even put a spin on a classic 
            that everyone enjoys. If you need help narrowing down ideas you could start off with a theme for the night. If you prefer
            a more random method, you can put your games on a sheet of paper and pull from a jar. 
        P.S. I also do this to choose food for take out nights. I never know what I want to eat :) </p>

        <h3 class="heading_style">How to Set Up Your Game Night</h3>
        <p>Plan ahead, designate a night during the week, a month, or how ever often you would like to have family game night. Get everyone involved.
            Everything does not have to fall on you. Someone can set the table or area, while your preparing or ordeing the snacks. You can always look up ideas online like this one <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/kids-charcuterie-boards/" target="_blank">taste of home</a>. If you like background music
            someone could work on a playlist and have it going while everything is getting set up. Light a candle for some aroma therapy, make a floor pallet, dress in your
            comfy clothes or pajamas and enjoy the night. </p>
