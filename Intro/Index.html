        <h1> Family Time</h1>
   <p>Time is something that we cannot get back. Cherish every moment of the day that you've been allowed to have. Don't take 
      it for granted. Connect with one another, put the electronics away and laugh often. Things may be different than the way it
      was when I grew up when it comes to family time, but it doesn't have to be.

        <h2>No Phones Allowed</h2>
   <p> In a world full of technology, I like to take my children back to a time before computers, smartphones, and 
       video games baecame the main household entertainment. Games such as: 
       <ul>
        <li>Hide and go seek</li>
        <li>I Declare War</li>
        <li>Water balloon Fights</li>
        <li>Puzzles</li>
       </ul>
      Thats just to name a few.

   <h3>Go exploring</h3>
   <p>So many people take for granted the beauty in their own backyard. Having lived in the same city for so many years 
      you may think you've seen it all, but you would be surprised how much has changed and overlooked. For example the 
      City of Chattanooga may seem like a small town but over the last few years, there's been major developments. Even 
      with all of the new construction the natural beauties of the city have been preserved and plenty of <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=d7947bc416bf53c2582b307e02b7d8a862f2235f05feeac22934354cb32bfa11JmltdHM9MTczODEwODgwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=35ce397d-c6ae-6f8e-0228-2dcfc7096e38&psq=campsites+in+chattanooga+tn&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmlzaXRjaGF0dGFub29nYS5jb20vYmxvZy9wb3N0LzctYmVzdC1wbGFjZXMtdG8tY2FtcC1pbi1jaGF0dGFub29nYS8&ntb=1" target="_blank"> campsites in and near the city of chattanooga.</a>
